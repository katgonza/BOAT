# Background 

The Geophysics Department at Colorado School of Mines has a field session every year for rising seniors to apply the skills they have learned at Mines to their own projects in the real world. Field session lasts for 4 weeks, occuring directly after geophysics students complete their junior year. The past 4 years, the department has been lucky enough to go to Steamboat Springs, Colorado to conduct geophysical surveys to study all sorts of earth science related topics in the area. This is a great time for the students to not only use their skills in a new environment, but also allows students to research areas that haven't been extensively studied. This is actually the first year that the Geophysics Department has surveyed on water making this a very special project.
