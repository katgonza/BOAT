TODAY'S GOALS
make a side-by-side of the map and the profiles, color-coded?

create isobath plots of the temperature

take a look at the density profiles 
	interpret the compensation of temperature and conductivity
	colder and less conductive has the same density as warmer and more conductive water

create a jupyter book as a web-based application for our map

HRRR weather - cold email grad students
	undergrad in GP working with bia on a lake project, trying to get HRRR data, any advice on how to get 	previous forecasts over stagecoach

CTD transect
	define depth bins of half a meter
	choose certain distance in km
	create section spacings
	average the points that all fall in each section
	plot the section
	watch out for outliers
		seems to be horizontal variability, our call to average those into these plots

conclusions include 

	actual conclusions
		variability in the reservoir is so large and the weather is so local that it is hard to 		extrapolate the actual conditions of the reservoir
		
				
	future works and wishes
		get closer to the Yampa
		actually taking water samples
		build a schedule with times and locations of measurements 
		have 2 CTDs for simultaneous dock and cove measurements
		meteorological instruments
		traditional methods- GPR on the lake???? seismic near inlets??? QZ adapted to freshwater???

equation of state
	only after redo the profiles by averaging the profiles and adding density
		
11AM MEETING NOTES
bia's interpretation: 

	overall tendency of the shallower profiles to have warmer at the surface
		could be diurnal cycles, more efficient at warming the water at shallower depths

	think more thoroughly about the spatial relationship between points

	half a degree is something we could consider a change within precision
	
	if we're observing a layer of fresh water on the top, 
		could be rainwater or slightly warmer water that is flowing from the drain pipe instead of 		the inlet

		the water from the snowmelt is so much colder that it will automatically sink straight to the 		bottom

	temperature and density follow each other, different units tho
	is the conductivity behaving the in same way?
		higher conductivity but less dense???
		low conductivity 

	conductivity is playing more of a role in Harding cove but has a larger range of conductivities
	no confirmation of the pipe vs the inlet
		TASK: equation of state, how much of a change in conductivity corresponds to the density
			fix the temperature, change the conductivity, and see how much change in density we 			see
			do the same for temperature, but not useful for pressure
	
	the deeper we go, the less variable- boring but useful to show
		isobaths will be useful here
		fine if you lose resolution

	trivial to turn into xarray, and do the xhistogram from xarray for the CTD transect
		doesn't give you counts, but will arrange into 2D bins

BIN the colors in the map of conductivities and temperature
	0.05 range?
	use the manual to explore more about the precision and accuracy of the instrument

higher conductivity in the center of the reservoir?

isobath plots
	
if the water is at the surface
	if it is colder, it needs to be less conductive to balance the density
