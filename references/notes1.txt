compare coves with inlets and without inlets
	harding vs glizzy
	use close shallow measurements to measure river temperatures at inlets

create better figures
	cm ocean colormap
	plot profiles on the same plot

recommendations
	things to write down in the future
	equipment and mobile lab processes for geological sampling of the water

tidbits
	keystone does have a drainpipe inlet
	specific conductance of yampa from USGS 40-50 mS/cm, we didn't go near at all
		might support that the inflows are primarily fresh snowmelt

TODAY
	determine why we care (for the abstract)
		no freshwater, cause HABs? determine what Blue-Green
		because it's cool!
	
	compare HAR and MOR with inlet to KEY and GLZ w/o inlet
		create conductivity and temperature cross-sections at depth
		profile points of interest within each cove on the same plot for conductivity and temp
		'How do inlets change conductivity and temperature within a cove?'

	ask other group about the weather on the 17th and 18th
