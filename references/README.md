- Conductivity of freshwater ecosystems has increased due to a combination of salt pollution, accelerated weathering and soil cation exchange, mining and resource extraction, and the presencevof easily weathered minerals used in agricultural operations and urban infrastructure (Kaushal et al., 2018). The phenomenon has documented adverse effects on the chemical and biological integrity of freshwater ecosystem.

- The electrical conductivity of natural water is the composition of the pure water conductivity and the conductivity due to the dissolved substances; in most cases its characteristics are manifestations of the chemical composition of the surrounding area, and they vary from one lake to another, sometimes to a very large degree.

- Conductivity in lakes and streams generally ranges between 0 to 200 µS/cm, while in major rivers conductivity may be as high as 1000 µS/cm. Very high conductivity (1000-10,000 µS/cm) is an indicator of saline (salty) conditions.
