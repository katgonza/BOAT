Meeting with Colin on 5/27/2025

  We're going to be doing a project using the data excluding the docks
  
  Properties of lakes that change with space:
    Depth
    Temperature
  
  See how the mixed layer depth in a sheltered cove changes with time
  Most variability will probably be from day to day...
  Not a lot of thermocline going on because of shallow depth in coves
  Georeference the bathymetery as proof of concept
  
  Plot the profiles of all the coves seperately
  Stick to measurements from the same day to start
  
  Probably end up recommending data to be collected next year
    Collect data at either end of the reservoir
  
  More descriptive, what did we do, what do we want?
    What kinds of things can you learn from a sample of water

  Harding and Morrison are best bets for good data

  Data exploration
    Plot profiles from each day of each cove
    Extrapolate temperature at a set depth over the whole lake
    Kreiging Spatial Interpolation on the bathymetery as a proof of concept
    
  ___ on survey map and timeline summary
